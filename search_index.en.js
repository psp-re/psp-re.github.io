They are located in the .rodata.SceNid\nsection of every PRX, to identify which operating system or other external functions are\nused in the program. A NID consists of the first 4 little-endian bytes of the SHA-1 hash\nof the function name, and in later versions of the PSP OS, a salt.  Legend has it, \nthey can be bruteforced to discover the names Sony used for their functions, to aid in\nreverse engineering. Experienced cryptographers would have probably realized the problem\nbefore writing a program to check the results. \nThe problem\nSo it turns out, there are quite a few hash collisions for the first 4 hexadecimal bytes \nof a SHA-1 hash. Here are a few of my favourites, which you can check by running \necho -n &lt;name&gt; | sha1sum\non any linux pc (assuming checksum packages are installed). Note that you have to swap \nendianness (read the bytes backwards). \n\nI purposely chose two here that came up with the same NID for the function name, to \ndemonstrate the problem of hash collisions. If you're following along at home, run the \nfollowing at a linux prompt:\n\nThe results are\n\nIt is plain to see  that they start with the same 4 bytes (8 characters), and if you\nread the bytes (digit pairs) backwards, you will see the NID. So that's no good, \nwe have multiple possible answers to the same problem, and both of them are nonsensical. \nI'm unsure how functionnames were ever recovered from NIDs, after working through this.\nI know some of the function names were leaked in games with debug symbols,\nbut that doesn't account for all the kernel functions that were never used in games\nthat have been recovered. Maybe the salts narrow the problem down a bit, I'm not sure.\nI tested without salts, because I was told earlier versions of the kernel didn't use them,\nwith NIDs, and it was easier for me not to.\nMethods\nSo, if you want to try your hand at NID cracking, I'll explain what I did in this section.\nI wrote a parallelized Rust program that runs on a modern\ndesktop CPU. I was planning to later use GPUs for more parallelism/speed, but the \nridiculous results I got have me convinced it's not worth persuing further. \nIf you're unfamiliar with Rust, you can download it at https://rustup.rs, and learn how to use it at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\nThe (slightly messy) source of my program is below:\n\nI hard-coded the module name to look for functions of the sceSysreg module for this first\ntest, and was planning to cover other modules as well. The program then uses rayon's parallel iterator and itertools to calculate permutations of a wordlist, and calculates hashes of the permuations with openssl. I used a python program to build a wordlist from known nids (basically splitting camelcase into words), and got some unknown nids from the emulator \nJPCSP. My wordlist is at wordlist.txt and the nids I chose to crack are at unknown_nids.txt\nRust projects also have a Cargo.toml file with basic metadata, which I will supply below\n\nThe latest version of the code is available at https://github.com/sajattack/nidcracker.\nBuild the project like any other rust project, with cargo build --release, and the binary\nwill be output as target/release/nidcracker.\nSo I ran all this for a few hours, and you can see my results at https://gist.github.com/sajattack/dd4c6df4aec0de8b641216515bdc49ed\nConclusion\nI'm not really sure where to go from here. The results are nonsensical so I will have to\nfind another way to uncover kernel function names.

It was the first game console that I personally owned as a kid,\nand perhaps in some way it inspired me to become a software engineer. At the very least, \nit inspired me to hack, and hack it I did. Shortly after I got the PSP, I brought it to\na random electronics consultant in my hometown to perform the Pandora's Battery hack\nwhich required a soldering iron I did not have at the time. I know many others who\nhad similar experiences. \nRust and Puzzle Bobble\nLately I've been working on a project called \nrust-psp. It's exactly what you think \nit is, a rust-lang toolchain for making PSP Homebrew. We have achieved parity\nwith the unofficial C SDK for user-mode applications. \nWhat does an enterprising rust hacker do when he has met C? Go further. It all starts\nwith Puzzle Bobble. While reading the C SDK to translate it to Rust, I came across an\ninteresting comment in the source code:\n\nDebug information in Puzzle Bobble you say? Fascinating. After seeing this comment a few\ntimes in various files, I couldn't help but crack it open in radare2/Cutter. I had \npreviously attempted reverse engineering \nC64 Pacman, so I knew my way\naround the tool, and I was waiting on a PR to be merged before I could implement\nrust-std for PSP. So I cracked it open and found entire libraries that were not yet\nin the C SDK. Eventually radare2/Cutter became limiting and I switched to Ghidra.\nToday Puzzle Bobble, Tomorrow The World!\nI reverse engineered sceGuDebugPrint from Puzzle Bobble, and there are many things in \nPuzzle Bobble I still have to work on, but I couldn't help but wonder, \"How many other\ngames like this are there?\" The answer I've found so far is 12. If you find more,\nplease let me know. \nK great, but why did you make a website about it?\nI made this website to share findings with the community and have a central place\nfor this information on the web. You are welcome to contribute on github.\n","id":"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/why/","title":"Why Reverse Engineer The PSP?"},"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/words/":{"body":"\n“Words have a magical power. They can either bring the greatest happiness or the deepest despair.” -Sigmund Freud\n\nThe problem\nWhat went wrong when I initially tested my Rust nidcracker program? As I \nmentioned in the original post, high entropy and a small hash == garbage output.\nThe high entropy problem comes from using every permutation of 4 words from \n1000 words (give or take).\nThe solution\nHow can we solve it? Simple, use a shorter, more carefully crafted wordlist.\nUser Meeeow in \nThe PSP Homebrew Discord Server, \nOne of the main contributors behind UOFW, used \nmy same exact nidcracker program from the previous post, combined with some\nknowledge of what the functions with unknown NIDs did, chose specific words \nrelated to what the functions were doing, and successfully cracked a few unknown \nNIDs. \n\nLessons\nThe first lesson is, with the right wordlist, these NIDs can be cracked,\nand there's absolutely nothing wrong with my program, but with the approach\nI took to creating the wordlist for it. In the first blog post, I basically\nalleged that NIDs couldn't be cracked without the results being meaningless.\nI now know this is not the case. In fact, watch what happens if I cheat a bit\nand use known nids, with a wordlist built from words in those known NIDs.\n\nWithin seconds, we have hundreds of valid nids. (list shortened for blogpost) \nThat brings me to the second\nlesson: test the happy path before giving up. A coworker of mine says the \nhappy path hides bugs, because it's usually the things you don't think about\nthat cause problems in code. But, if we never test the happy path at all,\nhow can we ever be happy? In the previous blog post, I tested NIDs that had\nbeen uncracked for years, with 1000 words from NIDs we knew, and concluded\nthat a solution was impossible. I failed to ever test the happy path, and I\nwas unhappy with the outcome. It seems obvious now. \nIn conclusion:\n\nDon't worry, be happy. -Bob Marley\n\nPS: I wrote a hashcat module for NIDs after\nI was inspired by the successful outcomes of Meeeow.\n","id":"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/words/","title":"Choose your words wisely"},"https://psp-re.github.io/quickstart/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis short guide will present you all the necessary resources you need to start reverse\nengineering on PSP. This guide works for both reverse engineering kernel modules and\nuserland (most probably game) binaries.\nIt is supposed you already know how to reverse engineer: if you don't, check a Ghidra\ntutorial and preferably also a MIPS assembly course.\nNote there exists alternatives to Ghidra, for example using IDA Pro. Ghidra is used here because:\n\nits ecosystem is more mature, especially for PSP ;\nit's opensource and easy to install ;\nit has convenient features such as decompilation, etc.\n\nStep 1: getting a binary to RE\nIn order to get a binary to decrypt, you first need to pick:\n\nthe game binary, located in psp_game/sysdir/ of the game ISO, either boot.bin (unencrypted) or eboot.bin (encrypted) ;\nor an updater .PBP, if you want to reverse engineer the kernel.\n\nIn both cases, if you encounter a .PBP file or an encrypted file, you can use the\npspdecrypt tool to decrypt it.\nStep 2: setting up Ghidra\nInstall Ghidra and install ghidra-allegrex using\nthe included README. Note there are some limitations in the plugin: VFPU support is limited,\n64-bit return values or arguments (using two registers) are not properly handled.\nAfter Ghidra is setup, you can start it and install the\npsp-ghidra-scripts using the included README\nin order to fix function imports and exports.\nThen, you can download the pspsdk.gdt type archive for games, or\nuofw.gdt for kernel modules (or both, but that might cause incompatibilities).\nThese files were built using include files from the PSPSDK or uOFW using the File -&gt; Parse C Source... menu.\nIf you want to regenerate (or update) them:\n\nfor the PSPSDK, you need to insert in Source files to parse, from the src folder,\nbase/psptypes.h, debug/*.h, user/pspkerneltypes.h, user/*.h, then the rest of the .h files\nfor uOFW, you need to insert include/common/*.h, then include/*.h\n\nStep 3: analyzing the binary\nNow that Ghidra is up and running, you should:\n\nImport the (decrypted) binary file in Ghidra\nRun \"Analyze\" when prompted for it\nRun the SonyPSPResolveNIDs.py script\nImport the .gdt type archive into the Ghidra project (the same way you imported the binary file)\nIn the Data Type Manager open it with Menu -&gt; Open Project Archive...\nRight-click on the imported data type archive and use Apply Function Data Types\n\nIf you're reverse engineering a low-level kernel module addressing the hardware through the 0xB.......\nmemory range, you'll also want to run the SonyPSPMapHWRegisters.py script (you can run it anytime).\nNow all the imports should use the correct signatures, and you're good to go!\n","id":"https://psp-re.github.io/quickstart/","title":"PSP RE quick start guide"}},"docInfo":{"https://psp-re.github.io/":{"body":37,"title":1},"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/list/":{"body":83,"title":6},"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/nid-cracking/":{"body":327,"title":2},"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/why/":{"body":189,"title":3},"https://psp-re.github.io/blog/words/":{"body":201,"title":3},"https://psp-re.github.io/quickstart/":{"body":268,"title":5}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
