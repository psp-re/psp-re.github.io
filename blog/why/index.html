  Why Reverse Engineer The PSP?
</h1>

<p><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Sony Playstation Portable handheld game console is iconic partially because of it's
prolific homebrew scene. It was the first game console that I personally owned as a kid,
and perhaps in some way it inspired me to become a software engineer. At the very least, 
it inspired me to hack, and hack it I did. Shortly after I got the PSP, I brought it to
a random electronics consultant in my hometown to perform the Pandora's Battery hack
which required a soldering iron I did not have at the time. I know many others who
had similar experiences. </p>
<h2 id="rust-and-puzzle-bobble">Rust and Puzzle Bobble</h2>
<p>Lately I've been working on a project called 
<a href="https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-psp">rust-psp</a>. It's exactly what you think 
it is, a rust-lang toolchain for making PSP Homebrew. We have achieved parity
with the unofficial C SDK for user-mode applications. 
What does an enterprising rust hacker do when he has met C? Go further. It all starts
with Puzzle Bobble. While reading the C SDK to translate it to Rust, I came across an
interesting comment in the source code:</p>
<pre><code>&#x2F;* Note: Some of the structures, types, and definitions in this file were
   extrapolated from symbolic debugging information found in the Japanese
   version of Puzzle Bobble. *&#x2F;
</code></pre>
<p>Debug information in Puzzle Bobble you say? Fascinating. After seeing this comment a few
times in various files, I couldn't help but crack it open in radare2/Cutter. I had 
previously attempted reverse engineering 
<a href="https://github.com/sajattack/c64-pacman-disassembly">C64 Pacman</a>, so I knew my way
around the tool, and I was waiting on a PR to be merged before I could implement
rust-std for PSP. So I cracked it open and found entire libraries that were not yet
in the C SDK. Eventually radare2/Cutter became limiting and I switched to Ghidra.</p>
<h2 id="today-puzzle-bobble-tomorrow-the-world">Today Puzzle Bobble, Tomorrow The World!</h2>
<p>I reverse engineered sceGuDebugPrint from Puzzle Bobble, and there are many things in 
Puzzle Bobble I still have to work on, but I couldn't help but wonder, &quot;How many other
games like this are there?&quot; The answer I've found so far is 12. If you find more,
please let me know. </p>
<h2 id="k-great-but-why-did-you-make-a-website-about-it">K great, but why did you make a website about it?</h2>
<p>I made this website to share findings with the community and have a central place
for this information on the web. You are welcome to contribute on github.</p>
